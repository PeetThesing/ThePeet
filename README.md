# ✨ Hi! Welcome!
Its nice to meet you here. I'll tell you important and unimportant stuff about me.

## 👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently becoming a web-developer.

This means learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a lot more.

## ✊🏻 I'm a trainer for feminist self defense. 
Wendo stands for * Women Do it! * and the goal is to prevent violence against women and girls.
It's not martial arts, but a concept which takes the conditions of growing up as women and girls into account and empowers in everyday life.

## 🛼 I'm also a Roller Derby skater.
This is Roller Derby.
